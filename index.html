                This is my first professional work experience, I built a strong foundation in customer relations, sales processes, and warehouse operations. I analyzed customer needs to provide accurate product recommendations, meticulously managed store layout and product displays, and took responsibility for stock control and product organization in warehouse operations. During busy periods, I strengthened my speed, time management, and problem-solving skills, while also gaining valuable experience in communication, persuasion, and teamwork. This experience not only enhanced my operational competencies but also contributed to the development of my professional work discipline.
